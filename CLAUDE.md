# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Multiplayer local quiz game inspired by the Brazilian board game "Perfil". Players guess an entity from up to 10 progressive clues. Supports up to 9 simultaneous players via LAN (including HOST). The first player to join becomes the HOST, who controls game flow; all others are regular players.

## Architecture

This is a monorepo with two separate services that must both run concurrently:

- **`backend/`** — Bun + Elysia 1.x server on port **3001**. Handles all game logic, player sessions, and real-time events via native Bun WebSocket.
- **`frontend/`** — Next.js 16 App Router on port **3000**. Pure UI layer; all state comes from WebSocket events. Uses React 19, Material UI v7 (`@mui/material`), and Tailwind CSS v4 for styling.

The frontend connects to `window.location.hostname:3001/ws`, so it automatically works on LAN when accessed by IP. No build-time config needed for LAN play.

## Development Commands

**Both services at once** (from repo root):
```bash
bun startgame.ts   # starts backend (3001) + frontend (3000) in parallel, prefixed logs
```

**Backend only** (from `backend/`):
```bash
bun install
bun run dev        # watch mode
bun run start      # production
```

**Frontend only** (from `frontend/`):
```bash
bun install
bun run dev        # Next.js with Turbopack
bun run build
bun run lint       # eslint
```

There are no test suites; verification is done by running the game manually.

A root `tsconfig.json` exists solely to give the TypeScript language server type coverage for `startgame.ts`; it points `typeRoots` at `backend/node_modules` where `bun-types` is installed. It is not used by either service's own build.

## Backend Architecture

**Entry point:** `src/index.ts` — Elysia 1.x app (Bun-native) that handles:
- REST API at `/api/` for CRUD on disciplinas, temas, and cartas
- Native WebSocket at `/ws` (delegated to `src/ws.ts` via `wsHandlers`)
- `GET /health`, `GET /game-state`, and `GET /network-ip` status endpoints

`GET /network-ip` returns `{ ip: string }` — the machine's first non-internal IPv4 address via `os.networkInterfaces()`, falling back to `"localhost"`. Used by the lobby's invite QR code to produce a LAN-accessible URL.

**Game state:** `src/game.ts` — `GerenciadorJogo` singleton (`gerenciadorJogo`) holds all runtime state in memory (player maps, current card, turn tracking) and syncs to SQLite via `src/db/queries.ts`. State persists across server restarts through `carregarSessaoAtiva()` on construction.

**Database:** SQLite at `data/quiz.db` via `bun:sqlite` + `drizzle-orm`. Drizzle schema (for typed queries) in `src/db/schema.ts`; raw SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements in `src/db/index.ts:initDatabase()` (also handles `ALTER TABLE` migrations idempotently). Seeded on startup from `src/db/seed.ts`. `drizzle-kit` is installed as a dev dependency but there is no `drizzle.config.ts` — all schema changes must go through `initDatabase()` as idempotent SQL, not through `drizzle-kit` migrations.

Active session tables (in both `schema.ts` and `initDatabase()`): `sessoes_jogo`, `jogadores_sessao`, `respostas_pendentes`. Persistent stats tables (in both but **not queried** by the current game loop — exist for future use): `jogadores` (global scores/wins per player name), `historico_partidas` (past match outcomes). Content tables for the admin panel (in `initDatabase()` only — **not** in `schema.ts`, accessed via raw SQL queries): `disciplinas`, `temas`, `cartas`. Note: `tema_id` on `sessoes_jogo` exists in `initDatabase()` raw SQL and ALTER TABLE migration but is absent from the Drizzle `schema.ts` — use raw `sqlite.prepare()` (not `db`) to read/write it.

**WebSocket protocol** (all handled in `src/ws.ts`): All messages are JSON `{ event: string, data: any }`. On connect, server immediately sends `{ event: 'session-id', data: { id: string } }` — this ID is the stable Elysia `ws.id` (derived from a closure in `raw.data.id`, not a UUID). Connection tracking uses `connections: Map<string, ServerWebSocket>` keyed by `ws.id`. Helper functions: `broadcast`, `sendTo`, `broadcastExcept`.

> **Elysia WS internals:** Elysia creates a new `ElysiaWS` wrapper object on every handler call (`open`, `message`, `close`). `ws.raw` is the underlying stable Bun `ServerWebSocket`. Always store `ws.raw` in the connections map and use `ws.id` (not the wrapper object) as the key. Elysia auto-parses JSON messages before calling `message(ws, raw)`, so `raw` arrives as an already-parsed object, not a string — `ws.ts` handles both cases.

- Client → Server: `join-lobby`, `request-game-state`, `roll-dice`, `set-play-order`, `select-theme`, `start-game`, `reveal-clue`, `pass-turn`, `submit-answer`, `validate-answer`, `reveal-answer`, `restart-game`, `exit-victory-screen`, `sair-lobby`, `spectator-join`
- Server → Client: `session-id`, `joined-lobby`, `lobby-state`, `player-joined`, `player-left`, `dice-rolled`, `play-order-set`, `theme-selected`, `game-started`, `clue-revealed`, `new-answer`, `answer-correct`, `answer-incorrect`, `answers-updated`, `next-card`, `answer-revealed`, `victory-state`, `game-ended`, `game-restarted`, `return-to-lobby`, `answer-submitted`, `spectator-state`
- `spectator-join` is handled in `ws.ts` without registering a player — responds with `spectator-state` containing full session snapshot (or `{ gameStarted: false, players: [] }` if no active session). Any WebSocket connection receives all `broadcast` events regardless of whether it called `join-lobby`, so the spectator tab gets real-time updates automatically.
- `game-started` and `next-card` events include `currentCardIndex` (0-based) and `totalCards` for the card progress counter.
- Most turn-change events (`game-started`, `clue-revealed` on pass, `answer-incorrect`, `next-card`) include `turnStartedAt: Date.now()` — a Unix ms timestamp clients use to compute remaining time independently (no per-tick WS messages). `answer-submitted` is broadcast when any player submits an answer, signalling all clients to freeze their countdown display immediately.

**Scoring:** Cards start at 10 points. After the 2nd clue is revealed, points decrease by 1 per clue down to a floor of 1. Logic in `GerenciadorJogo.calcularPontos()`.

**Turn mechanics:**
- When a player's answer is marked **wrong**, the turn passes to the next player (`proximoJogador()`). The frontend resets `hasAnswered` for all clients on `answer-incorrect`, so players can submit again when their turn comes back.
- When a player's answer is **correct**, the current card ends (3-second delay then `next-card` or `victory-state`). `proximoJogador()` is **not** called — the winner keeps their turn for the next card (`proximaCarta()` only advances the card index and resets clues).
- A player can reveal at most one clue per turn (`revelouEstaTurno` flag, persisted to DB and reset when the turn changes).

**40-second turn timer:**
- `GerenciadorJogo.iniciarTimerVez()` records `this.turnStartedAt = Date.now()` and sets a 42-second server-side `setTimeout` as a fallback auto-pass. Clients receive `turnStartedAt` in turn-change events and independently compute remaining time with `40 - (Date.now() - turnStartedAt) / 1000` in a 100ms interval.
- Client auto-pass fires at ~40s (via a `useEffect` watching `timeLeft === 0`); the server fallback fires at 42s if the client never responded.
- When a player submits an answer, `pausarTimerVez()` cancels the server timer and `answer-submitted` is broadcast so all clients freeze their countdown display.
- `cancelarTimerVez()` is called at the start of `revelarResposta()` to prevent a ghost auto-pass during the 3-second reveal delay.
- On reconnect, `handleRequestGameState` includes `turnStartedAt: gerenciadorJogo.getTurnStartedAt()` so the reconnecting client can resume the correct countdown offset.

**Card source:** Cards are fetched from the DB by `temaId` if a theme is selected; otherwise fall back to all cards, then to the hardcoded `gameCards` array in `src/models.ts` (mirrored in `frontend/lib/cards.ts`).

**Session reactivation:** When a client reconnects, `reativarJogador` in `game.ts` looks up the player by searching `allJogadores` (already scoped to the current session via `buscarJogadoresSessao`) rather than the global `buscarJogadorPorSessionId` — this prevents old records from previous sessions matching and causing fake "lobby full" errors or HOST identity loss. One remaining guard: if the stored socket ID is non-empty and differs from the reconnecting socket, reactivation is refused (prevents multi-tab identity theft).

**Input validation:** `src/schemas/jogo.schema.ts` — `validarNome`, `validarResposta`, `validarIndiceDica` validators used by `ws.ts` before processing events.

## Frontend Architecture

**Pages** (all in `frontend/app/`):
- `/` (`page.tsx`) — name entry screen, stores name in `localStorage`
- `/lobby` (`lobby/page.tsx`) — waiting room; HOST sees theme selector (disciplina → tema), control buttons, invite QR-code modal, and **Abrir Tela Espectador** button (HOST only); the invite modal fetches the LAN IP from `GET /network-ip` so the QR code encodes `http://<lan-ip>:3000` instead of `localhost`; players see dice roll
- `/game` (`game/page.tsx`) — main game screen; HOST view shows full card + clues + answer validation panel; player view shows revealed clues + answer input + card progress counter. Overlays (correct/wrong/nobody) imported from `app/components/RespostasOverlay.tsx`
- `/espectador` (`espectador/page.tsx`) — read-only spectator screen opened in a new tab from the lobby (HOST only). Three states: **waiting** (floating card animation + spinner + player list with dice rolls), **in-game** (two-panel layout: card+clues left 65%, host badge+timer+scoreboard right 35%), **end-game** (trophy + ranking, no action buttons). Connects via `lib/spectatorSocket.ts`, never emits action events
- `/victory` (`victory/page.tsx`) — final ranking; HOST can restart or exit to lobby
- `/admin` (`admin/page.tsx`) — content management UI for disciplinas, temas, and cartas (CRUD via REST API); tab components live in `admin/components/` (DisciplinasTab, TemasTab, CartasTab)
- `/sobre` (`sobre/page.tsx`) — static about/landing page; navigates to `/` directly

**Socket singleton:** `lib/socket.ts` — `getSocket()` returns a lazily-created `WsClient` instance (native WebSocket wrapper), connecting to `hostname:3001/ws`. The `WsClient` class mimics Socket.IO's `.on/.off/.emit` API. All messages are JSON `{ event, data }`. Session persistence uses a UUID in `localStorage` (`perfil_session_id`) sent as `?sessionId=` query param on connect; `'connect'` event fires only after the server sends `session-id` (so `socket.id` is populated before handlers run). Auto-reconnects up to 5 times with linear backoff (1 s, 2 s, 3 s … per attempt). UUID generation uses `crypto.randomUUID()` with a `Math.random()`-based fallback for non-HTTPS contexts (mobile browsers on HTTP).

**Spectator socket:** `lib/spectatorSocket.ts` — `getSpectatorSocket()` returns a separate `SpectatorWsClient` singleton. Connects with `?spectator=true` (no `perfil_session_id`) so it never interferes with the player's session. On receiving `session-id`, immediately emits `spectator-join`; the backend responds with `spectator-state` (current game snapshot) without registering a player. Receives all broadcasts passively. Never call `join-lobby` or any action event from this socket.

**Game constants:** `lib/config.ts` — exports `GAME_CONFIG` (max players, correct-answer display time, clues per card). Prefer changing constants here over scattering magic numbers in components. Note: `SERVER_PORT` and `SERVER_URL` fields exist in this file but are **not used** — `socket.ts` hardcodes `hostname:3001/ws` directly.

**Fallback cards:** `lib/cards.ts` — frontend-side duplicate of the hardcoded `gameCards` array (same data as `backend/src/models.ts`). Used if the backend sends no card data.

**Shared overlay components:** `app/components/RespostasOverlay.tsx` — exports `Modal`, `CountdownRing`, `OverlayAcerto`, `OverlayErro`, `OverlayNinguemAcertou`. Each overlay component manages its own sound (`soundManager.play`) and auto-dismiss (`setTimeout`) via `useEffect`; the parent just sets `show={true}` and provides an `onDismiss` callback. `game/page.tsx` and `espectador/page.tsx` both import from here — do not duplicate these definitions. `OverlayNinguemAcertou` stops its sound in the `useEffect` cleanup so audio cuts immediately when the overlay dismisses.

**Sound singleton:** `lib/soundManager.ts` — `soundManager` (exported instance) pre-loads all `HTMLAudioElement` objects at module evaluation time. Call `soundManager.play(name: SoundName)` or `soundManager.stop(name)` in client components. Guard against SSR is built-in. Sound files live in `public/sound/`. Existing names: `answearRight`, `answearWrong`, `revealClue`, `sendButton`, `victoryScreenSound`, `passTurn`, `noOneCorrect`, `rolldice`. To add a new sound: copy the `.mp3` to `public/sound/`, add the name to `SoundName` and `SOUND_PATHS` in `soundManager.ts`. The singleton persists across Next.js navigations, so background/looping sounds must be stopped in the socket event handlers that trigger navigation (e.g. `return-to-lobby`, `game-restarted`), not only in the HOST's button handlers.

**`clue-revealed` dual purpose:** this event fires both when a clue is revealed AND when a turn is passed (with the same indices). Sound logic in `game/page.tsx` uses `revealedCluesCountRef` to distinguish: `newRevealed.length > count` → play `revealClue`; equal → play `passTurn`.

**Routing flow:** All navigation is driven by socket events; pages push routes reactively (e.g., `game-started` → `router.push('/game')`, `return-to-lobby` → `router.push('/lobby')`).

## Key Constraints

- Max 9 players per session (enforced in `GerenciadorJogo.adicionarJogador`).
- Each player may only reveal one clue per turn (`revelouEstaTurno` flag, persisted to DB).
- Only the HOST can: start game, validate answers, reveal answer, select theme, restart.
- `validate-answer` auto-calculates points server-side; the client does not send a points value.
- Disconnects are soft (socket ID cleared to `''`, player kept in DB); `sair-lobby` is a hard remove.
- The HOST does not accumulate score and their score is not displayed in either game view.
- `bun run --watch` sends SIGTERM (not SIGINT) on file changes, so `gerenciadorJogo.limparTudo()` (wired to SIGINT only) is never called on hot reload — stale session data can persist in SQLite across restarts during development.
